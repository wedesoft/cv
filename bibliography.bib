  abstract={Here the design and operation of a novel transmission electron microscope (TEM) triboprobe instrument with real-time vision control for advanced in situ electron microscopy is demonstrated. The NanoLAB triboprobe incorporates a new high stiffness coarse slider design for increased stability and positioning performance. This is linked with an advanced software control system which introduces both new and flexible in situ experimental functional testing modes, plus an automated vision control feedback system. This advancement in instrumentation design unlocks new possibilities of performing a range of new dynamical nanoscale materials tests, including novel friction and fatigue experiments inside the electron microscope.}

  abstract={Dynamically typed scripting languages have become popular in recent years. Although interpreted languages allow for substantial reduction of software development time, they are often rejected due to performance concerns. In this paper we present an extension for the programming language Ruby, called HornetsEye, which facilitates the development of real-time machine vision algorithms within Ruby. Apart from providing integration of crucial libraries for input and output, HornetsEye provides fast native implementations (compiled code) for a generic set of array operators. Different array operators were compared with equivalent implementations in C++. Not only was it possible to achieve comparable real-time performance, but also to exceed the efficiency of the C++ implementation in several cases. Implementations of several algorithms were given to demonstrate how the array operators can be used to create concise implementations.},

  abstract={The use of wavelets in the image processing domain is still in its infancy, and largely associated with image compression. With the advent of the dual-tree hypercomplex wavelet transform (D-HWT) and its improved shift invariance and directional selectivity, applications in other areas of image processing are more conceivable. This paper discusses the problems and solutions in developing the DHWT and its inverse. It also offers a practical implementation of the algorithms involved. The aim of this work is to apply the DHWT in machine vision. Tentative work on a possible new way of feature extraction is presented. The paper shows that 2-D hypercomplex basis wavelets can be used to generate steerable filters which allow rotation as well as translation.},
